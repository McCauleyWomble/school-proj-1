<p>During the pandemic I did a lot of traveling, training and contests for my Wakeboarding and Snowboarding. It changed a lot of our contests for a while but within the last one-two years it's become normal again. Being able to still do what I love during the pandemic made me really grateful for what I get to do because I know so many people struggled. </p>
